# Theia Automation

Automate functional tests running on Theia with Cypress.io in COBOL LS.

#### Prerequisite:

- Windows Environment
- Linux Environment

## Procedure:

## 1. Install `yarn`

   You can test it, e.g. <code>yarn --version</code>

## 2. Install all dependencies

   <code> cd /your/project/path (where you cloned the repository)</code>

   <code> yarn install --frozen-lockfile</code>

- Add commands files from https://github.com/eclipse/che-che4z/tree/master/tests (check instructions in README). For some reason it is not working as expected [installation](https://github.com/eclipse/che-che4z/blob/ab4789702b0ca6ec7061c0eb5417c4c45bcdf32d/tests/package.json#L12), so we should do it manually:

  <code> npm run ts:build </code>

- Refer to https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/blob/master/doc/Developing.md
- For Windows specific:
  https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/blob/master/doc/Developing.md#building-on-windows

If you are using VS Code, you can reload the window. Go to `View > Command Palette` or `Shift+Cmd+P` on OS X and `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows and type `reload window`.

## 3. Prepare the Theia environment for test suites

:information_source: **Note**:

- In order to run the LS COBOL LOCAL test suite, open a workspace in Theia, and put the test COBOL files in the root folder of that opened workspace.

- The test COBOL files can be found in the `test_files/project` subdirectory of a project. Theia version is `1.5.0.`
Beside the workpsace loading, also we need to mount the `test` folder in order to run `TC318696`. 
  #### Run Theia in docker:

  <code>sudo docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 -v /home/$USER/$project/plugins/:/home/theia/plugins -v /home/$USER/che-che4z-lsp-for-cobol/tests/test_files/project/:/home/project -v /home/$USER/che-che4z-lsp-for-cobol/tests/test_files/test:/home/test --name theia theiaide/theia-{java or full}:1.5.0</code>

  OR

  #### Run builded Theia:

  ```
  cd theia/examples/browser
  yarn start /home/$USER/che-che4z-lsp-for-cobol/tests/test_files/project/ --hostname=0.0.0.0
  ```

## 4. Run Cypress

If you are running in interactive mode, and you want to run only one test, add `.only` to the specific test case, e.g.
` describe.only(...)` or ` it.only(...)`. For more information, check this [link](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests.html#Excluding-and-Including-Tests)

Helpful [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ub1que.add-only). Add `.only` extension does exactly what it claims to do. It filters your test by adding `.only` keyword to your `it()` block. Itâ€™s about 1 second faster than typing it yourself. 

| Command Description                                                                            | LSP                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Run in interactive mode                                                                        | `npm run cy:open`                                                                |
| Run in CLI mode **ALL** spec files in specific folder with Chrome browser                      |`npm run cy:run:all`   |
| Run in CLI mode **ALL** spec files in specific folder with Chrome browser in **headless** mode | `npm run cy:run:all:headless`  |
| Run in CLI mode **SPECIFIC** spec file in specific folder with Chrome browser                  | `npm run cy:run -- --spec cypress/integration/LSP/copybook.spec.js --browser chrome`   |
| Run in CLI mode  **ALL** spec files in specific folder with Chrome browser in **headless** mode with video recording on| `npm run cy:run:all:headless -- --config video=true`|

#### Test Retries

Check this page: https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/test-retries.html#Introduction. Cypress >=5.x has test retries ability by default. Global configuration can be found in `cypress.json` file.

:information_source: **Note**: by default Cypress expects the Theia is running on `localhost:3000`. If your Theia server runs on different URL, you could provide it in command line:

| Command Description         | LSP                                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| baseURL in interactive mode | `npm run cy:open -- --config baseUrl=http://<IP>:<port>/` |

## 5. Generate report

To generate a HTML report after you run the test. 

Run `npm run generate:html:report` for final test report.`generate:html:report` combines the 2 commands: `merge:reports` abd `create:html:report` into one. 

The `merge:reports` command will merge all the json files from our `cypress/report` directory and store them in a new file called `cypress-tests-report.json`. 

The `create:html:report` command will generate the html report from `cypress-tests-report.json` and save it a new directory `cypress/reports/final_report`.

## 6. Test tags
We are using custom tags to slice up Cypress test runs. Check the tags bellow in the table

| Tag | Description |
| ----|-------------|
| **smoke**| Include or exlude smoke tests.|
|**flaky** |Include or exclude flaky tests.|
|**flaky_theia**| Include or exclude tests in Theia which has some problems|
|**bug**| Include or exclude tests which found bugs in the product|
|**investigation**| Include or exclude tests under investigation|

### Usage
Select tests by passing a comma separated list of tags to the Cypress environment variable `CYPRESS_INCLUDE_TAGS`, e.g.,
```
CYPRESS_INCLUDE_TAGS=smoke npm run cy:run:all
```
Skip tests by passing a comma separated list of tags to the Cypress environment variable `CYPRESS_EXCLUDE_TAGS`.
```
CYPRESS_EXCLUDE_TAGS=flaky,bug npm run cy:run:all
```
Combine the two for more complex testing strategies.
```
CYPRESS_INCLUDE_TAGS=smoke CYPRESS_EXCLUDE_TAGS=flaky,bug npm run cy:run:all
```
On Windows it can be performed as
```
set CYPRESS_EXCLUDE_TAGS=flaky
```
and then
```
npm run cy:run:all
```
 By default, `flaky`, `flaky_theia`, `bug` and `investigation` are excluded from the cypress run. 
## 7. Add new tests

Please check this page: https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices.html

Check commands in `node_modules/@eclipse/che-che4z/tests/src/*.ts` (they could be helpful to create tests and functions should be available in autocomplete).

`cypress/support/index.js` is a place where you can put global configuration to run before each test.

And finally add the test directly to the `cypress/integration/LSP/{PUT_NAME_HERE}.spec.js`.

:information_source: **Note**:

Pre-commit is enabled. Also you can run `eslint` before commiting anything, then run manually this command:

`npm run lint`
